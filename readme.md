## Motivation:
### My partnet and I are really competitive when we play board games with each other, neither of us like to lose, which is good for me because I can usually win most the time. However, Connect Four is my achillies heel, my partner absolutley owns mental space in my head with how much I lose at Connect Four. After I implement the minimax AI and hone my skills, I will have my revenge tour! 
## Prototype View:
### Here is my initial drawing of the playing field:

## Minimum Viable Product:
- As a user, I should be able to face off head to head with someone, alternating turns

- As a user, I should be able to know when I win or lose the game
- As a user, I should be able to reset the board to start a new game
- As a user, I should be able to see the instructions pop up when "how to play" is clicked
- As a user, I should be able to hear game piece falling sound after every turn and all the game pieces falling on reset
