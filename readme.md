## Motivation:
### My partnet and I are really competitive when we play board games with each other, neither of us like to lose, which is good for me because I can usually win most the time. However, Connect Four is my achillies heel, my partner absolutley owns mental space in my head with how much I lose at Connect Four. After I implement the minimax AI and hone my skills, I will have my revenge tour! 
## Prototype View:
### Here is my initial drawing of the playing field:
